# Roadmap of new features

## New Functionality

* fix how stickers look in graphs
* figure out how to show better emojis in graphs
* get consistent colours for the legend

## New Graph Ideas

Word counting:

* most swearing
* which words are most unique to each person? (hard)
* punctuation usage?

Message content analysis (may require preprocessing):

* first time saying I love you? lol
* most common two-word pairs?
* change in frequency of certain words over time (maybe detect largest differences? most unique each month or term?)
* which pairs talk to each other the most in a group chat
* how long someone takes to respond
