# Roadmap of new features

## New Functionality

* word count CSV
* fix how stickers look in graphs


## New Graph Ideas

Message counting:

* compare # messages per waterloo term, per month (line graph)

Word counting:

* most swearing, most loving(?)
* which words are most unique to each person? can be done absolutely or by diff of squares
* most common words over n chars (test out n = 4 to 16)
* most used emoji (todo: convert text emoticons to emoji)
* punctuation usage?
* graph for each person's first name

Message content analysis (may require preprocessing):

* first time saying I love you? lol
* most common two-word pairs?
* change in frequency of certain words over time (maybe detect largest differences? most unique each month or term?)
* which pairs talk to each other the most in a group chat
* how long someone takes to respond
